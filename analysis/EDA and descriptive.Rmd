# Purpose

Make a plot that shows leafhopper densities over time with harvests and maybe weather.

# Load Data

```{r data, echo=TRUE}
df <- read_rds(here("data", "cleaned", "hopper-weather.rds"))
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(field, interharvest.no) %>% 
  summarize(length = last(date) - first(date),
            mean_temp = mean(temp_mean),
            mean_precip = mean(precip_mm),
            mean_density = mean(hoppers/n_leaves))

df %>% 
    summarize(length = last(date) - first(date),
            mean_temp = mean(temp_mean),
            mean_precip = mean(precip_mm),
            max_precip = max(precip_mm),
            mean_density = mean(hoppers/n_leaves))
  
```
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(precip_mm)) + geom_histogram()
```


Summarize for plotting

```{r}
plotdf <- df %>% 
  group_by(date, field) %>% 
  summarize(density = sum(hoppers / n_leaves))
```


# Plot

add lines/colors for harvests?
add panel for temp
add panel for precip

```{r}
ggplot(plotdf, aes(x = date, y = density, color = field)) + geom_line()
```
