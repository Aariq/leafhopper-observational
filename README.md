This repository contains data and analyses for **Scott ER, Wei J-P, Li X, Han W-Y, Orians CM (2021) Differing non-linear, lagged effects of temperature and precipitation on an insect herbivore and its host plant. Ecological Entomology. https://doi.org/10.1111/een.13023**


This project uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage package dependencies. After downloading this (or forking it via GitHub), open the .Rproj file. After installing and loading the `renv` package, simply run `restore()` to install the exact configuration of R packages originally used in this analysis.

To reproduce analyses, run the .Rmd files in the "wrangling" directory first, followed by the .Rmd files in the "analysis" directory.
