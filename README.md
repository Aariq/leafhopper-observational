This repository contains data and analyses for a manuscript in preparation for submission to Ecological Entomology.  The field work for this project was conducted at Shanfu Tea company in Shaxian, Fujian province, China in 2017.

This project uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage package dependencies. After downloading this (or forking it via GitHub), open the .Rproj file. After installing and loading the `renv` package, simply run `restore()` to install the exact configuration of R packages originally used in this analysis.

To reproduce analyses, run the .Rmd files in the "wrangling" directory first, followed by the .Rmd files in the "analysis" directory.
